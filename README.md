# About
QuizHub is a pub quiz without the pub. Designed as a multiplayer quiz app, QuizHub allows players to host and join private quiz rooms, by utilising the Cloud Firestore. Players can select from a variety of quiz categories and can choose to play in real-time against their friends or opt for Solo Mode. Upon joining, players get to select a username and avatar, with high scoring users getting added to the leaderboard.

# How to play
Select a username and avatar on the landing page, before proceeding to the dashboard. From here, you can choose to host, join or play solo. If host is selected a random room code will be generated- please share this code with your friends and have them click on the join option and enter the code. Once everyone wanting to play is visible in the lobby, the host can click to start the quiz. When every player has answered each question, the host will be able to proceed to the next question. At the end of the quiz the host can choose to play again, or return to the dashboard- returning to the dashboard will close down the quiz room. Players can also return to the dashboard at the end of the quiz if they don't want to stay to play another game. Users score points for winning a quiz and will be added to the leaderboard (they can accumulate points by using the same username to join with each time.)
